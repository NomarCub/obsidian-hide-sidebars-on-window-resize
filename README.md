## Hide Sidebars on Window Resize

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It automatically hides the sidebars when the window gets too narrow and shows them when it gets wide again.

You can change the minimum width for both the left and right sidebar.

This is a fork of a currently unmaintained repo by mybuddymichael that you can find [here](https://github.com/mybuddymichael/obsidian-hide-sidebars-when-narrow).
